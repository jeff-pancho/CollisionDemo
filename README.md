# CollisionDemo
A demo of the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) to calculate collisions between convex polygons. This demo was created with JavaFX.

## Purpose
I created this project to test out collision detection using the SAT since I needed it for my game [HexagonClone](github.com/jeff-pancho/HexagonClone), which uses polygons.

## How to run with Eclipse

`git clone` the project somewhere

In Eclipse, go to `File -> Import` then click on `General -> Existing Projects into Workspace` then select the folder you cloned.

After that, simply run `Main.java` as it has the main method.

## Controls

Drag one of the polygons to test out the collision detection. The dragged polygon will turn magenta if it collides with another polygon. It will turn black once it stops colliding.
